# Homework_Week_6
#This is the homework for Week 6
#I will update this as I continue to update the file as it it currently incomplete. The repository is being set up at 10:49 am on Monday October 23, 2017
#I uploaded this document at 10:58 am. Edits will happen over the next two days. 

#The updates from 1:29 pm on October 23, 2017 cannot be pushes to github so the R markdown file will be more updated than the HTML file 

#Changes from Oct 24 uploaded at 10:31 pm. The following still cannot be completed (PI and labelling the equation on the second question; the function still does not work properly).
